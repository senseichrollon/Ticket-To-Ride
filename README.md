SLHS CS2 Spring Project 2019

TEAM:

OBJECTIVE:
To create a graphical, Java based implementation of the board game "Ticket to Ride".

HOW TO MAKE EDITS - IMPORTANT!
1. Make the edit in your local branch, then commit it to your LOCAL BRANCH
2. Required Template for Commit Message: INITIALS, HH:MM AM/PM(time), DD/MM(date), DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES
3. Create a new temporary branch. Name it as follows: temp-NAME-DATE
4. Submit a pull request for the branch. Try to only do this when you know that somebody else is present to review your request, or you'll be stuck in limbo. Only approve your own request when you ABSOLUTELY need to, and double check the revisions when doing so. When approving your own pull request, send a message on Hangouts to ensure transparency.
5. Have someone else approve the pull request, and then delete the temporary branch.

PRO TIP: Submit pull requests around 2-3 minutes before the end of class.
